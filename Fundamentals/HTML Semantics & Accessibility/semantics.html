          <h2>What is semantics?</h2>
          <p>
            In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€”
            for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript
            have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have"
            (rather than "what does it look like?".)

            <p>
              In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which
              gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top
              level heading on your page."

            <p>
              In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing
              different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is
              being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?
            </p>

            <summary>Semantic JS</summary>
            <p>
              In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter,
              and returns an element with that string as its textContent. Would
              you need to look at the code to understand what the function did
              if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?
